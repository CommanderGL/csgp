# CrossScar Game Protocol

The CrossScar Game Protocol or csgp is a protocol designed to get games running
everwhere. It is designed to provide an abstraction layer for available apis for
many platforms. One use case for this can be making a game for "retro" hardware.
If you use csgp you can not only test locally on your machine but also get it
running on other devices in the future.
